## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kailichou/chapter1-automate-boring-stuff/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kailichou/chapter1-automate-boring-stuff/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Suggestion to Ask Questions Correctly
In practice, I found these three tips are important.
- Explain what you are trying to do, not just what you did. This helps your StackOverflow crowds have a better idea of your goal.
- Copy and paste the entire error message and your code while asking for help. It saves reader's time and help you out quicker. 
- Explain what you’ve already tried to do to solve your problem. This tells people you’ve already put in some work to figure things out on your own.
